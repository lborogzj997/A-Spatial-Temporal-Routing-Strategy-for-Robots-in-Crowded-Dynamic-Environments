## This repository contains following items for the spatial-temporal routing project:
- Matlab demo for spatial-temporal routing algorithm
- Guidlines on how to impiment high-level path planning algorithm into 3D pedestrian simulator in ROS Packages
- A costom differential drive Robotic wheelchair model in urdf format.
- XML based scene (Generate from THÃ–R DATASETS: real human trajectoires for human-robot interaction testing purpose)
- MAT based scene (Generate artifically for testing robot navigation with large crowd size)


## Software Requirements:
### System:
- Ubuntu 16.04.7
- [ROS Kinetic] (http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (may work with other versions, tested and deployed on Kinetic)

## Require Packages:
- ROS Packages: https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros
- Matlab Packages: https://web.casadi.org/get/

## Installation

### Step 1
Set up the testing envornment in your workspace (SPACiS)

```cd [workspace]/src
git clone https://github.com/maprdhm/Spaciss.git  
cd Spaciss
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ../..
catkin_make or catkin build (twice at the first time)
```

### Step 2
-Dowland the robot_wheelchair file in your workspace (catkin_ws/src)
-Replace the experimental_package file from Pedestrian_simulator file

## Example usage
``` roslaunch experimental_package Scenario_test.launch
